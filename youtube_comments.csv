@J.AndresBarberyCueto,"Interesting how times change. Back when I was a teen, people complained Thor was becoming too serious, too well mannered by Avengers: Age of Ultron. This inspired the change in Thor: Ragnarok to try and make Thor more badass like Captain America was made badass in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. They made Thor escape the alley of seriousness for sure. Then Infinity War made him a real war hardened badass. Bro Thor in Endgame was unexpectedly funny and well made but then people complained Thor was becoming too clownish in Thor: Love & Thunder. Now we are back at serious Thor. Hopefully it is more of a Infinity War Thor. Interesting how times change.",1,2026-01-29T04:00:25Z

it was released on December 23, so 12:23 (expressed as month:day), added to its own code 1:24 (expressed as month:day), results in 2:17, which is February 17th.
– Let’s take the third teaser as another example:
it was released on January 6, so 1:06 (expressed as month:day), added to its own code 1:11 (expressed as month:day), again results in 2:17, which is February 17th.
– Let’s take the fourth reel dedicated to thanking viewers for the views of the four teasers:
it was released on January 16, so 1:16 (expressed as month:day), added to its own code 1:01 (expressed as month:day), results once again in 2:17, which is February 17th.
The result is constant and always comes out as 2:17 — essentially February 17th! You can try this with all the teasers that were released; it will always remain 2:17.
I’m convinced that the Doomsday trailer will be released on February 17th, and that the Endgame “time play” theory doesn’t make sense at all!

the ""e"" and ""ber"" is a glitch (to make the code visible not visible as an ambiguity"" these characters appear only in the reels of the instagram accounts US, marvel, RDJ and russo brothers. while the character glitch in the instagram account marvel the ""e"" does not appear but ""bre"" appears which would be ""dicemBRE"" in Italian while in English it would be ""dicemBRE"". the character glitches vary for the reels of the accounts marvel fr (france), marvel de (germany), marvel brazil... you can check! while the 02 is the time... January is made up of 31 days, so the date of publication of the post + post code = 2:16 .. ok, but remember that the reel was published at 10:00pm so 10:00pm + 02 = 12:00pm so 2; 16: 12:00pm and therefore 2: 17: 00:00am!",0,2026-01-21T15:51:12Z

I am a very big fan of Marvel Studios, and my favorite character is Thor. I am also a big fan of Chris Hemsworth from Pakistan 🇵🇰.
I want to send this message, although I don’t know if it is okay to contact you this way.
The reason is that I heard from some places that Thor might die in Avengers: Doomsday or Avengers: Secret Wars. Is this true?
If it is true, then please don’t do this, because Thor means a lot to us fans. If Thor dies, what will happen to us fans? Also, Thor 5 is still expected.
Please consider my message.
Thank you.",0,2026-01-20T11:55:59Z

@imadeyoureadthis.9743,"Thor becoming potentially the face of Marvel after the absolute blast that was his character arc in Ragnarok and the movie as a whole, then his role in Infinity War was a sight to see. In Endgame he shined much like the rest, but was going through yet another important character arc. Everything should have come together in Love & Thunder, but much like the MCU after Endgame (except Spidey & GotG) it was lackluster and a poor attempt at re-using and absolutely overused formula, it was everything Ragnarok was but absolutely worst and lackluster. Hopefully, Thor is able to come around as a character this time, less Ragnarok formula, now semented as a legend, back yo badass God of Thunder Thor",0,2026-01-18T05:51:09Z

@BUSSYCRACKMON5TER,"I'm piecing this together. I could be WAY off. 
FANTASTIC FOUR POST CREDITS WITH DOOM: After the post credits in Fantastic Four with Doom and Franklin they'll pick up and we'll see the Fantastic Four lose to Doom. Franklin is taken. Reed and the team build a ship to travel the multiverse to follow him. Doom told them Franklin was the key to saving the multiverse. They travel to the recruit. 
STEVE ROGERS TEASER: The scene with Steve could be Doom trying to recruit, much like he might have tried with the Fantastic Four, but he takes the child instead. Leverage? Powers? Who knows. Reed will recruit Steve.
X-MEN TEASER: I think the X-Men and Fantastic Four and Captain America initially fight. Reed warns them of Doom and the incursions and Magneto will die preventing an incursion. This could be the cause of all the destruction. In the comics Polaris and Sugar Man use their powers to boost Magneto to push the incoming earth on a collision course with the 616 back. This is what Magneto was referring to with accepting death in the trailer and the black king accepting the checkmate on the chess board. The X-Men are only in the film briefly. We'll get a spectacular scene of the Fantastic Four and Captain America fighting the X-Men. Captain America vs. Wolverine. Nightcrawler vs. Reed. Gambit, Beast, Monica Rambeau and others will be there. The X-Men are mostly only in this part of the film. Charles and maybe Beast will play larger roles. Monica,  Beast, and Charles leave with the FF and Cap.
THOR'S PRAYER: Thor's prayer is likely after Doom tried to recruit him. Instead, he took Love. Another powerful child. I don't see connections from the comics or other teasers and films in this scene. 
WAKANDA/FF TEASER: The location in the final teaser is the Talokan Necropolis. Thus, desert. This could be before or after the X-Men. In the comics there was a time where Namor and Black Panther went to war. Even while at war, when meeting with the Illuminati they had an uneasy truce. The illuminati met where T'challa was exiled. The Necropolis. In the Black Panther films they showed the Wakandan City of the Dead, the Necropolis. In the comics it was described as where ""Wakandans go to die."" But perhaps this is Namor's people's. The desert.  Where Talokans are sent to die. By the time we catch up with them Namor and Shuri have been allies for a while and have traded technology. This is the meeting site of the Illuminati. Charles, Hank, Reed, Namor, Shuri, Steve. Shuri is likely giving the Wakanda Forever arm sign to Steve. They've met. They likely won't call themselves the Illuminati, but by meeting at this location that's the reference. It COULD still be Wakanda, but the Black Panther and Wakanda Forever Necropolis and this location don't appear to be the same.  
The (Wakandan) Necropolis is also where Thanos, Namor, and the Cabal meet after Namor betrays the illuminati and helps the Cabal destroy an incursion bound earth, saving the 616 universe and giving them more time. At some point Namor could go to Doom and help him destroy another earth preventing an incursion. Maybe even with Loki, Sentry, and others, forming the Cabal. 
THUNDERBOLTS/NEW AVENGERS POST CREDITS SCENE: I feel like this happens last. With the number of established characters in the plot thus far introducing all the New Avengers and what I'll call the Mighty Avengers would make everything up to now VERY convoluted. I will say Doom might be with the others the whole time posing as Tony. When the Illuminati, (for lack of a better name) arrive the New Avengers go to meet them, they are intercepted by Sam's Mighty Avengers and a fight breaks out. They stop at the sight of Steve (and possibly Tony, Doom in disguise), and reunions happen. I feel like here is where Thor comes into the story again. He arrives via the bifrost. Everyone together again. 
SPECULATION ON THE CLIMAX/RESOLUTION: Tony reveals himself to be Doom. He has the mask, and after this point we'll likely never see his face. I think they'll use Doom/Tony for most of the film for the RDJ face time,  but the climax of the film will reveal that he's Victor Von Doom. RDJ is GREAT at voices and accents and will likely be very clearly distinct from Tony. There won't be a connection between the two. He high jacks Sentry's Void powers and escapes with him to the Void.this is where the children, Doom, the Void (with a direct connection to the Void itself from Loki and Deadpool and Wolverine) start building Battleworld out of destroyed universes. With him will likely be Namor and Loki, the Cabal. Loki's connection to the sacred timeline will likely come into play for the building of battleworld. The scene shifts back to the heroes. The final incursion begins. The ship was designed to withstand the multiversal collapse, they just need to escape the impact. The ship escaping the collision of two Earth's would be a very visually stunning display if cataclysmic destruction,  and the ship struggling to get far enough would play out like the end of Indepence Day. Everything goes white. 

The film logo appears, and the somber version is the Avengers theme from Infinity War's credits plays. 
POST CREDITS SCENE: Doctor Strange or Bruce or someone we didn't see in the film wakes up in bed. They don't recognize where they are. They open the curtains to reveal they're in the void/battleworld. 
NOTES: In the very end we might see Doom on his throne with white robes referencing Secret Wars. Strange as his right hand man wouldn't be out of the question. 
I don't think this is EXACTLY how it will go,  but this is my closest interpretation based on everything we've gotten up until now.",0,2026-01-16T07:40:25Z

@VishinSingh-bp3mz,"I think here Thor has got unworthy, because he has short hair, just like Unworthy Thor storyline, in Ragnarok his hair got cut forcefully but Thor cutting his hair intentionally means he is unworthy. The events of Unworthy Thor took place after Gorr Saga comics, when Nick Fury said ''Gorr was right'' to Thor, so maybe it was someone else who said this to Thor, because Gorr was the last villain Thor fought, then in the end of Thor 4, Thor was using Mjolnir, but here he is only carrying Stormbreaker, and to defeat a villain like Doom he would need both weapons, so him only carrying the axe is another indication that he is unworthy.",0,2026-01-15T10:09:16Z

@stevenhunter3345,"I never fault a movie studio for leaning on nostalgia to fire up fans for a new project, but with Doomsday the nostalgia is the ONLY THING it has going for it. The MCU has been a commercial and creative wasteland since Endgame, and there is no overarching in-universe story driving us toward this movie. I know nostalgia can grab you in the feels without warning, but this cinematic universe has become a dumpster fire. There’s nothing RDJ, Evans, or Hemsworth can do about it.

In late 2022, Chris discovered he carries two copies of a particular gene, increasing Alzheimer's risk 8-10 times. While this discovery prompted a career hiatus, Hemsworth clarified the break was primarily to spend time with his three children after a decade of continuous work. He remains selective about projects but continues acting, including returning for future Marvel films.",1,2026-01-06T06:32:10Z

This ultimate form grants him cosmic awareness, reality-bending abilities, and power to challenge universal threats, making him one of the mightiest beings in the Marvel universe, though still below entities like The One Above All.",0,2026-01-05T05:32:29Z

Almost every movie leading up to End Game was like a worldwide event that almost everyone I knew would talk about and be excited for, but now I haven't heard anything about any of the movies/shows after that. I tried watching some of the new stuff, but nothing feels the same anymore. Everything feels cheap, rushed, and uninteresting, and I barely understand what's going on now.

@TomReactionsz,"Theory 1.
Loki may be able to hear Thor, but I doubt he can actually come to him. First of all, Loki cannot leave his place — he is bound to holding the entire multiverse together. So if Thor does see him, it would most likely be only an illusion.

However, I believe a more likely scenario is that Thor will meet Loki within the dimension of the timelines themselves. I think agents of the TVA will come for Thor at Loki’s personal request, most likely right after Thor’s prayer.

They will approach him and say that the God of Stories needs his help. Only then will Thor discover that this god is actually his own brother — Loki.",1,2026-01-02T17:47:03Z

@aquasky77,"I know the comedy in Thor: Love and Thunder went too far for many people and that Thor felt too unserious and unkingly. People turned on Taika, even though he gave us Thor: Ragnarok, which actually revived the character. Let's not be ungrateful.

You also have to understand Thor’s state of mind. In Endgame he was dealing with grief, guilt, and trauma after Infinity War. He came close to stopping Thanos and still failed, and that showed in his physical and emotional state. After Endgame, once everything was restored, the guilt lifted but he was left aimless and without purpose.

Loss does not always produce dignity or wisdom. Sometimes it produces apathy, distraction, or shallow humour. That reaction is uncomfortable to watch, which is why people reject it, but discomfort does not make it unrealistic. We are used to seeing people lash out, and sometimes withdraw, but we rarely see characters respond by becoming flippant, goofy, or unserious, even though that is just as human.

The seriousness in this Doomsday teaser exists because Thor is no longer a wanderer. He has purpose again. He has a child to take care of, and the responsibility to raise her the right way. When someone is responsible only for themselves, they can afford to drift not when you have someone else to take care of. That is how I see it anyway.",1,2026-01-01T11:35:42Z

@buccaneercat,"Why can’t Thor be serious when he actually looks like Thor? I’m referring to his long golden locks. Thor hasn’t had that combination since Avengers Age of Ultron. It’s a bloody crime. I was hoping his last appearance would fully embrace the Nordic Viking look. Absolutely jacked, with a full beard, and long golden braids. At least they’re not making him a Taika Waititi driven joke like before… but he really should have his long hair back. It makes no sense why it would be styled and cut all modern, when he’s seemingly been off world taking care of his adopted daughter.",0,2025-12-31T22:23:01Z

That must be why these characters and so many of the Marvel movies touch me and so many of my generation so deeply and evoke such powerful emotional responses.  Many times, I wonder; how many children, like me, found solace in and were lifted up by those silly comic book hero's my father sneered at or my mother panned.  Many of the characters came from the same lowly station as myself with ordinary, everyday lives and common-place struggles of their own, but who taught a generation cast adrift that we could rise above our place in the world and if not become hero's ourselves, at least live decent, kind lives and raise our children with love and caring.",0,2025-12-31T20:19:41Z

@ReapTheWhirlwind,"Thor is both serious and silly y'all. Neither incarnation is wrong! Most importantly, both are canon. This particular version of Thor is interesting because he has stakes again. When he has an ideal, a person, or a nation to fight for Thor is unstoppable but when he's alone he tends to be a bit of a joke. Love really centered him in a way being king of Asgard or even an Avenger could never have done and tbh I think Odin would be proud of him. 

One thing that hasn't been shown on-screen yet is the Thorforce and I wonder if it will show up now. Odin's family has a hereditary power that's passed from father to child that grants a lot of raw strength and other abilities. Hela was clearly invested with a decent amount of the Odinforce and that's why it took Ragnarok to kill her. It's one of those comic book powers that does what the story needs it to do and tbh the Avengers will need all the help they can. Especially if Doom is in his Rabum Alal guise.",0,2025-12-31T19:59:31Z

On the other hand it’s kinda lame returning to former glories. They really can’t accept that it will never reach the heights of the previous Thanos phase. That was lightning in a bottle never to be repeated.
However Marvel is a business and they have to make money. Creatively we’ve come to the end of superhero movies I believe. I love them but it’s overkill at this point.

@q.h.s5051,"My issue with this Avengers is the lack of buildup. Doom has only been hinted at through Fantastic 4 while Thunderbolts showed they're on their way and Spider-Man will probably have something for him too.
Thanos and the stones were all shown leading up to Infinity War, hell even the first Avengers was properly built up to from Day 1 with Iron Mans post credit scene.
This just feels out of nowhere for the sake of an Avengers movie
Bringing Steve back feels desperate and we obviously need to forget about Kang.

a child. A life untouched by the storm.
Lend me the strength of the All-Fathers,
so that I may fight once more…
defeat one more enemy…
and return home to her not as a warrior…
but as warmth,  To teach her not battle but stillness. The kind I never knew

But now fate has given me something I never sought,
 A child, a life untouched by the storm.
Lend to me the strength of the Allfathers 
So that I may fight once more, defeat one more enemy and return home to her. Not as a warrior but as warmth, to teach her not battle but stillness, the kind I never knew.
Please, father; heed my words.""

@GREENMANTISSHOW,I loved Ragnarok but they really over did the comedy aspect in Love and Thunder. Too much of anything can be bad I mean even water can kill you if you drink too much of it! So unfortunately that's what happened there with L and T so much so that even Chris Hemsworth said that they needed to change directions with Thor if he was going to reprise him. This right here and many other things tells me that Marvel is finally listening and making the appropriate decisions that will win back most of the fans and have them be back on top again!,0,2025-12-31T07:05:51Z

Bringing back phase 1 characters after a trash phase 4 and 5 is a sign of serious issues forcing them to rely on nostalgia rather than the strength of the story or the characters from phase 4 and 5.

@f0x-0n-f1re,"Imagine if Thor: Love and Thunder had maintained his character development from Infinity and Endgame. It's fantastic that we are getting back a more serious, grounded character; it strongly reminds me of Kratos from the newer God of War games, who desperately wants that stillness rather than war and fighting. 

This scene in the trailer reminds me of several comic panels and even scenes from Thor in the animated Avengers films. 

Also, with this being the Second teaser and grounded in what seems to be fatherhood, I wonder if we will have a more accurate depiction of Doom and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father, which turned him into the ruthless man he has become.",1,2025-12-30T21:52:42Z

Example: “…..and return home to her, not as a warrior but as…..warmth?” 

Is that what he said? Warmth?  Wolf? 🐺 I honestly don’t know.  I turned on the auto subtitles and it said “warmth”",0,2025-12-30T21:28:53Z

@Afrinaut,"I'm sorry, but it's a little late for Thor and Asgard to be treated like real-supernatural gods now. Should have introduced Thor like this in the first Avengers film, and phase 1. Thor being equal to and greater than Hulk in strength, Asgard being magical and feeling lived-in/real, Thor's dynamic with Tony Stark as the themes of god vs man, magic vs science was for the most part ignored, Ironman being paranoid of Asgard's power thus building the Thorbuster suit, & Thor shifting the favor of battle when he teams up with the rest of the Avengers. Thor did not deliver the finishing blow to Thanos; all of his solo movies are mid, we will never see Thor and Odin humble Galactus, we will never see Thor's relationship with the Omega Mutant Storm and the rest ofthe mutants, why did the MCU waste the goddess Sif etc. The only thing great about the Thor movies was the goddess Hela played by the amazing Cate Blanchett. This is what happens when Kevin Feige turned Thor into a comedy-relief character depowered- ""ancient alien"" with human-super soldier strength, a supernatural species with god tier strangth and battle experience. Thor's character arch is realizing that humanity is brave and that he can count on them, not depowering him because MCU writers don't know how to handle god-like strength in a team-setting and characters. The best writing for Thor in a show, was the animated Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (and maybe Avengers Assemble).",0,2025-12-30T20:54:10Z

@LuckyGuy1980,"I like the fan theory that Tony Stark was always a Doom variant…that Tony Stark who we know and love who saved the universe in EndGame was actually originally adopted by his parents and is biologically Doom (there was never a biological Tony Stark from the Stark bloodline due to biological Tony died at birth or didn’t exist in the timeline)…the adopted non-biological Tony Stark was a Doom variant who ended up being a hero in all the Iron Man and Avengers movies and not a villain that turned into Dr Doom in the timeline. 

I really like that idea and it would be an amazing twist and would explain why Doom is played by RDJ because RDJ was always a Doom variant 🙂👍

Yes, that means we never saw an actual biological Tony Stark / Ironman in all the movies leading up to now. RDJ would have always been Doom…which means you can actually cast another huge superstar actor to be the real biological Tony Stark like Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt or someone on that scale 🙂👍

@NightHawk0429,"I really hope this is indication that Marvel is transitioning into adapting more serious Thor stories, like Donny Cates' amazing run. I would LOVE to see Hemsworth do a MUCH more serious role, not the fake serious role like Hollywood usually does when they cast him in Men in Black or Furiosa, but the REAL depth he is capable of delivering like his performances in Extraction and Rush. Especially now that Galactus is in play, a new Thor movie where Thor is actually coming to terms with what it means to be Allfather to an Asgard that no longer exists, and a Galactus that is ready to simply give in and be consumed could be really, REALLY sick. Could you imagine a Thor movie with Hemsworth giving an intense performance alongside Ralph Ineson? Please Marvel, you have so much potential at your disposal!",3,2025-12-30T20:00:47Z

@evanpodwalny3531,"Doom is kidnapping children. I'm putting that down now. He was holding Franklin Richards (who has the power cosmic) at in the post credits of First Steps. The Steve Rodgers trailer revealed that Steve and Peggy have a child (who I'm guessing somehow has powers, possibly related to Steve's exposure to the Infinity Stones). And now this teaser is indicating that Thor's adopted daughter, Love (who appeared to have some short of cosmic power in Love and Thunder) will be part of the story. My guess is that Doom is planing to harness these children's powers to dominate the Multiverse.",5,2025-12-30T19:29:49Z

@MiamiGameHunter,"It's easy to forget that Thor is one of the most tragic MCU characters at this point: he's lost both his parents, his hammer, his Warrior Three comrades, Asgard was destroyed, half his people were then slaughtered by Thanos, Thanos snapped Loki's neck in front of Thor, he watched Thanos murder Heimdall, he ultimately failed to stop Thanos from enacting The Snap by going for the chest instead of the head, he spent five years in a drunk depression and turned fat, he lost his fellow Avenger Iron Man, and finally his true love Jane Foster died from cancer in his arms. Basically everyone Thor has ever loved as died. So yeah, he is NOT going to play around when he comes face to face with Doom.",0,2025-12-30T19:17:42Z

Marvel truly wanted to show they weren’t going to make the same mistake from Love & Thunder by making the character too funny. Even Hemsworth at one point said he regretted playing the character because he seems more like a parody of himself. Chris and Marvel really want to make sure that we get what Thor is supposed to be.

This warms my hearts for Thor’s Arc",31,2025-12-30T18:22:43Z

@जहांहवामिले,"""Pibursuca"" is a viral internet riddle or meme, a nonsensical word created from taking the middle letters of four common food words (Pizza, Burger, Sushi, Cake) after removing their middle parts, intended to confuse people into thinking it's a deep phrase but it's just silly wordplay that sounds like ""pee-bur-soo-kah"" or ""pie-bazooka,"" a playful ""fake deep"" puzzle for social media. 

How the Riddle Works:

Start with: Pizza, Burger, Sushi, Cake.

Remove the middle part:

Pizza -> Pi

Burger -> Bu

Sushi -> Su

Cake -> Ca

Combine the remaining letters: Pi + Bu + Su + Ca = Pibursuca.

The ""joke"": When read aloud, it sounds like ""Pee-bur-soo-kah,"" leading people to overthink it, with funny guesses like ""pee bazooka"" or ""suck a peepee"". 

Why It's Popular:

It's a classic example of a ""fake deep"" meme designed to make people feel confused or dumb for not getting the simple, silly answer.

It's a social media trend, often shared on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, prompting many comments of bewilderment and attempts to solve it.",0,2025-12-30T17:44:36Z

One of the things that makes a movie good is proper stakes, proper stakes only feel significant and high *if* the end result is irriversible.   Its why the ending of endgame felt so emotional because it was final... but now they bring back Steve, they bring back Thor and they even bring back RDJ... which throws all the stakes of the previous movies out the window and I feel that does a big disservice to the franchise and what it had built up over the years. Whqt is the point of caring if the charqcters make it through if you can just undo everything at any point. That said this is just one thing, the movie isn't out yet so I'm hopeful that it will be a great movie overall nonetheless.",0,2025-12-30T16:22:59Z

@SuperDonny21,"I know this is may sound wishful thinking but I have been thinking about Secret Wars and how it will be done and I don't think it will be like the books as I don't think Marvel will bring back multiple villains to fight the Avengers, F4 etc.

I am however imagining that Marvel may do something similar to Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Near the end, Doom takes Odin's power and becomes a god (temporarily of course due to his Odin sleep) after beating Hulk, X-men etc he revives some of them to be his slaves to fight of the remaining heroes. So I think it would be cool to see something like this happen at the end of Doomsday, have a battle where Doom gains God level powers, defeats all the main heroes but have some of them die in battle including Thor. Then see Doom starting with Thor, resurrect him with green eyes so mind controlled by Doom, then a few more possibly Cpt Marvel and some of the OG X-men. Whilst the remaining heroes who are still alive look on in shock, Doom then mergers 2 universes together (possibly Fox and MCU earth 616) and creates battle world.

This imo could totally work compared to the comic version where all heroes and villains are transported to battleworld to do battle against each other whilst Doom watches with the Beyonders powers in amusement.",0,2025-12-30T16:12:21Z

@masterbobby410,"‎okay now hear my words,my theory is I think the short character trailers Marvel's been releasing in recent times are may be mid or post credit scenes of some of their cancelled projects ,that's why at the end of each trailer there is something like so and so character like Steve Rogers or thor  and .... will be returning to avengers doomsday like the way marvel used announce for characters like for antman at the end of civil war,for starlord at the end of gotg3,for spider man ,for black panther and ...so on and I think for now way home marvel gave us doctor strange multiverse of madness trailer as it's post credit scenes so far i remember, like a little change .so as they are  cancelled projects or uncontinued projects these scenes got left and they are releasing for us as part of promotional content to built up the hype (FOR THE GOOD) for the movie.its just good move that's all  its a little bit too early for an usual/average marvel movie but it's different for doomsday ,waiting for it can't wait (POSITIVE , 🤞) just my theory

Sometimes you don’t meet your nemesis before he shows up at your door 🔫💥!! He might’ve been sent by known enemies or you did something you wasn’t supposed to do, like Cap creating an alternate timeline or Loki deciding not to follow in Kang’s footsteps steps and just letting millions of alternate timelines flourish without getting pruned.

@MainulHasan0112,"I feel like I’m about to cry, man. I’ve been a Marvel fan for as long as I can remember. I didn’t just watch the movies—I read countless comics. I knew the stories, the arcs, the characters. Before Endgame, I had almost every iconic dialogue memorized. Marvel wasn’t just entertainment back then; it was a part of my life.

But in recent years… Marvel disappointed me. Again and again. I held onto my last bit of hope with Love and Thunder, but even that let me down hard. Slowly, I drifted away from the MCU. The excitement faded. The magic felt gone.

Then I watched this video. And suddenly—something snapped back. It felt like I was home again. Thor’s look reminded me of Infinity War and Ragnarok. That look. That haircut. That aura. That feeling.

It’s been 8 or 9 years, man. And all at once, I was back in those school days—endless debates with friends, arguing about theories, hyping upcoming movies, living and breathing Marvel. Those were golden days.

Now I’m standing here, nostalgia hitting like a hammer to the chest. My eyes are heavy. My throat feels tight. These tears… they’re real.

@zayan_alvy.15,"(1) Just imagine Marvel Comics bought Stranger Things, and they made ""Vecna"" as the origin of ""Knull"",  after he consumes all the people of Hawkins and becomes the ultimate void of darkness☠This is how Vecna became the ""Knull"" in another universe! And the ""11"" is the origin of ""Dr. Jeane Gray."" 🌚

- Thor is once again a warrior (or rather, a protector now) who wants nothing more than to protect those left, instead of the awkward goofball from Ragnarok, Endgame (tho this one was really justified by grief) and Love and Thunder. Also, love how they brought his short hair look back.
- I love how the countdown from the end is being constantly updated to reflect in real-life time before Dommsday's release, not only between each teaser but between the time it was launched in theaters and the time it was publicly launched on YT.",0,2025-12-30T15:30:01Z

@Jestingwind85,"That code “1e : 17ber : 02020” seen at 1:12 is very likely a TVA-style multiverse timestamp.
1e = hex for 30 → possibly Earth-30.
17ber looks like a deliberately broken month name → non-linear time (classic TVA / multiverse glitch).
02020 is a palindrome → time reset / loop, pointing to 2020, the start of the MCU Multiverse Saga.
Put together, it suggests:
👉 Earth-30 collapses or resets around 2020, acting as an early multiverse sacrifice.
That fits perfectly with Avengers: Doomsday, setting up incursions, timeline destruction, and eventually Doctor Doom creating Battleworld, just like in Secret Wars.",22,2025-12-30T15:30:00Z

@EvanSaltare,"I like the emphasis they're placing on children and being parents thus far. Franklin Richards, Thor's child, Cap's kid. It's an evolution of Ant-man, Tony's daughter, Tony's parents, Hawkeye's loss. Sucks that I still can't get past RDJ as Doom though. Really missed the mark there. Feels like it lessens Iron Man's loss in Endgame and detracts from Doom as a character. Hopefully, they're gonna pull the rug out on that and the real actor is a secret. Having RDJ play Doom for that F4 post-credits scene where we don't even see his face seems like a red herring.",0,2025-12-30T15:26:22Z

@cinimodg0251,One thing I’ve even noticed with the color palate of the Steve Rodger’s trailer is that both these trailers have a similar feel and tone. I loved the cgi and visuals in both infinity war and Endgame for their distinctive feels but this feels like something otherworldly. It almost doesn’t even feel like a marvel movie and I respect them so much for the way they use the color palate to give it its own feel. Great Job Russo brothers!!,0,2025-12-30T15:22:19Z

but for kindness is one of the most

emotional moments in MCU history

Son of Odin and the God of Thunder

seeing him choose to fight as a teacher

Tony & Pepper had Morgan. Thor adopted Love (Gorr's daughter). Reed & Sue had Franklin (I'm assuming we'll be introduced to Valeria later). And Steve has a child (presumably with Peggy).

Maybe he'll create Battleworld, and force the heroes to participate using their children as leverage. He could use Love or Franklin as a conduit to run Battleworld like his comic book counterpart did to Owen Reece (Molecule Man).",0,2025-12-30T15:15:25Z

@WesleyJMurrell,"This is honestly the best version of Thor I’ve seen. You can see Thor is scared of Doctor Doom because he is probably more powerful than anyone he has faced before and now he’s praying to Odin to give him the strength to defeat him and return to Love. The MCU deserves a Thor who is more serious and less comedic. I’ll admit his humor was pretty well-balanced in Ragnarok, Infinity War and Endgame but in Love and Thunder, he took it too far and turned himself into some kind of a joke. I’m really glad that the Russo Bros decided to give Thor not just his Infinity War look back, but also the redemption arc he deserves.",0,2025-12-30T15:14:51Z

@dostproductions14,"A more serious Thor always makes the story feel bigger and more meaningful. Love this direction. ⚡

Seeing Thor take things seriously again really brings back that epic mythic vibe.

Thor works best when the tone is heroic and intense — this feels right.

A grounded, focused Thor is exactly what the franchise needed.

Serious Thor + high stakes = perfect combination.

This version of Thor reminds me why I loved the character in the first place.

When Thor is driven by purpose, the entire universe suddenly feels heavier.

A mature Thor facing real consequences? Yeah… I’m here for it.

This is the Thor that feels like a true god of thunder — powerful and disciplined.

Thor with emotional depth hits way harder than jokes ever could.

The tone feels darker, but still heroic — this balance is perfect.

A more serious Thor means the threats are real — I love that energy. 💥

Thor stepping up as a leader again feels long overdue.

This version of Thor feels wise, experienced, and dangerous — as he should. ⚡

When Thor stops joking around, you know something massive is coming.

The weight on Thor’s shoulders is clear — and that performance shows it.

A focused Thor feels unstoppable. This is the character evolving.

Thor has always been at his best when the tone leans epic and mythological.

The emotional gravity here really sets this apart from his earlier films.

Serious Thor feels like the true protector of the realms again.

The maturity in Thor’s character is shining through — love the growth.

This feels like a warrior god preparing for something truly catastrophic.

You can really feel the responsibility in Thor’s decisions now.

This tone makes Thor feel legendary again — powerful, calm, and relentless.

Sometimes the strongest heroes are the ones who stop laughing and start fighting. ⚔",1,2025-12-30T15:10:16Z

That difference feels intentional. In the same preview, we see Steve Rogers sealing the Captain America suit in a box, clearly framing that version of the character as part of the past. Because of that, it seems likely Chris Evans will appear in Avengers: Doomsday, but not as Captain America , possibly as a different character or variant.",0,2025-12-30T15:06:21Z

@Deathshuck,"It's really sad how they're doing everything they can do undermine and ruin Endgame. Returning RDJ as a whole other character (unbelievably pathetic) to pulling Captain America out of retirement, ruining also his perfect character arc.

It's not a surprise why, since every single thing they have done since Endgame has been a mediocre flop, not realizing that the magic was in the actors and the performances, not the characters themselves and CGI.

Once you kill Iron Man, retire Captain America, there's nothing left. They did it, but now they have to do everything in their power to bring it back, because they cornered themselves. It was over.",0,2025-12-30T15:01:17Z

Now it just looks like Thor wants to do more good things for the child love but it looks like he hopes to seek a great challenge one either he survives it or he doesn’t and before he doesn’t survive it He wants to make sure his child love knows what is true and right by being a hero and a warrior when she comes of age, and this will be Thor biggest moment yet",0,2025-12-30T14:58:04Z

I just hope this movie does justice to his character, because Thor: Love and Thunder didn’t really do it for me. His whole family is gone, his home is gone — there’s so much weight to his story. I really hope we get a serious, grounded Thor this time",1,2025-12-30T14:49:38Z
@tiago9977,"I'm glad we're getting a more serious Thor again (like in Infinity War).
Ngl, I kinda wish they could go back & make changes to previous projects somehow. The most disappointing thing about Thor: Love & Thunder imo is how close it was to being a great film. They just had to: 
→ *show Gorr acc butchering Gods*
→ *give us more time w/ Jane as Mighty Thor* (i.e. her gaining her powers & training/ hanging out w/ Valkyrie in New Asgard) 
→ *cut the excessive satire / add more serious moments* , i.e. get rid of: 
- Stormbreaker's sentience & jealousy 
- joking about Sif losing an arm 
- the Gods joking about sacrifices & orgies 
- Axl wanting to change his name 
- Gorr scaring & mocking the kids 
- joking about Asgardians eating kids 
- the screaming goats 
- the kids getting Thor's powers in a Spy Kids moment, etc 
→ *remove the Asgardian kids subplot entirely* : 
- most scenes involving them were just cringey 
- Thor barely took it srsly anyway 
- Thor should've just gone after Gorr bcos he was killing Gods, etc.",0,2025-12-30T14:49:38Z

Happy, Waititi haters? ""Finally"" a serious Thor. You never know he'll be able to make jokes, even funny ones. You never know. It has to be all the same as the wonderful comics, all serious, bloody, and ""deep""...

Jokes aside, I'm very happy about the return of several characters. Less so for others (Chris Evans, RDJ, the boring old X-Men)... I hope Marvel Studios plays it cool this time.

@Doom10838,"AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY - THE REVISED MASTER SCRIPt its my prediction if marvel heard this it will be awesome
Endgame post credit scene doom tony ke grave ke paas khada hota h aur mask dikhta h aur bas end 
1. The Brutal Start: Thanos is Nothing
Movie ki pehli hi frame mein hum ek bhayanak ladayi ka nateeja dekhte hain. Doctor Doom ek hi punch mein Thanos ka pura skeleton bahar nikal leta hai (Comics ka iconic moment). Bina kisi mehnat ke wo Thanos jaise titan ko mita deta hai. Ye scene pure theater mein sannata phelane ke liye kaafi hai.
2.starting life - happy life of captain in alternate timeline 
3. First Half: The Missing Kids & Steve’s Entry
Wahin se story 616 mein aati hai jahan Red Hulk, Sam Wilson ko maar raha hota hai. Tabhi Mjolnir ke saath Young Steve Rogers ki entry aur ""Bhabhi"" wala callback from endgame (Peggy ke saath reunion).ye story connect hogi brave new world se jahan red hulk se ladaai ho rha hota h 
4. Interval: The Hopeful Moment
Steve aur Peggy ka Sam se milna aur Avengers Tower mein Fantastic Four ke saath milkar ye realize karna ki Franklin, Love aur Steve ka beta—teeno gayab hain. Aur yeh connect hogi fantastic 4 first step se jahan doom Franklin ko lekar chala jaata h aur fantastic 4 main earth 616 m aate h 
5. Second Half Opening: The TVA Revelation
Interval ke turant baad Steve, Thor aur Reed TVA pahunchte hain. Wahan Loki unhe milta hai (Thor aur Loki ka sabse emotional reunion). Loki unhe h story btata hai:
 * The Kang Massacre: Doom ne kaise Council of Kangs ko kachre ki tarah saaf kiya.
 * Kang’s Final End: Loki batata hai ki Kang ke har ek variant ko Doom ne mita diya hai taaki multiverse mein sirf uska raaj ho.
 * The Defeat of a God: Loki khud accept karta hai ki wo Doom se haar gaya aur ab Incursion shuru ho chuka hai—Universes ek dusre se takra rahe hain.
6. The Void Battle: Tony’s Consciousness
Loki unhe Void mein bhejta hai jahan Doom ka main ""Weapon"" (Masked Tony/RDJ) khada hai. Steve aur Tony ki fight hoti hai, lekin jab Steve uske bachche aur Morgan ka naam leta hai, toh Tony ko sab yaad aa jata hai.
 * Hum dekhte hain kaise Doom ne Tony ki grave se uski body nikali aur use apne control mein liya.
7. The Climax: Suit-Up and Assemble
Tony wapas hosh mein aakar Jarvis ke saath suit-up karta hai. The Big Three (Cap, Thor, Iron Man) dobara ek saath khade hote hain.
 * Sam, Steve ko bolta hai ""Aap bolo"".
 * Steve (with Hammer & Shield): ""AVENGERS... ASSEMBLE!""
 * Sab milkar Doom ki sena (Doombots) ko dhote hain.
8. Post-Credit: The Real Mastermind
Saari ladaai ke baad pta chalta hai ki ye sab Doom ka ek chhota sa game tha. Real Doom apna mask nikalta hai aur wo Cillian Murphy nikalta hai. Wo kehta hai: ""The Multiverse is now my Battleworld.""
Theory ke 3 Sabse Bade Highlights:
 * Thanos & Kang ka disrespect: Ye dikhata hai ki Doom ""Ultimate Villain"" hai.
 * Thor & Loki Reunion: Fans ko unki aakhri mulakat ka sukoon mil jayega.
 * Two Captains & One Iron Man: Legacy aur Original heroes ka best mix.
Teacher's Remark:
Marvel ki sabse badi problem (Kang) ko bhi story mein itni safai se khatam kiya ki koi sawaal hi nahi bacha. Aur Tony ka grave se nikalna aur wapas Iron Man banna... ye cinema ka sabse bada comeback hoga.",0,2025-12-30T14:27:25Z

@marcm.3888,"My theory:

When we saw Thor crying holding Deadpool in Deadpool and Wolverine it's because Deadpool does something that saves Thor or his daughter. Thor doesn't know he can regenerate and thinks he's gonna die. He's all emotional and thankful and then Deadpool just regenerates. Emotional moment switched to a funny one.",0,2025-12-30T14:23:23Z

@CocoJambo1337,"Dear brothers and sisters, the time of the apocalypse is getting closer and closer. The church will soon leave this mortal earth, leaving the rest of people to taste the wrath of God. It's not too late to give your future to someone who truly cares about you - Jesus Christ, our Lord and God. All you need to do is believe in The Gospel. In His sacrifice, in His bloodshed for us, according to the Holy Scriptures, for he came 2,000 years ago to free us from our sins. It is also necessary to believe in his burial and subsequent resurrection on the third day, according to the Holy Scriptures. If you believe in this, if you truly believe that Jesus Christ has done it all for you, then you will not have to participate in the apocalypse and its horrors.

Grant me the strength of all fathers. So that I can fight once more, defeat a new enemy, and return to her. Not as a warrior, but as a protector. They do not know war, but worry.
